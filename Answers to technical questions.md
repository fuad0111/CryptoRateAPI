1. How long did you spend on the coding assignment?
I Spent 5 Hours beacuse this weak i was so busy and i dont have enough time to spent more time on this project , im sorry for that
If I had more time, I would add the following:
Pagination and Filtering: Add support for paginated results and query filters for better user experience.
Rate Limiting: Implement rate limiting to prevent abuse of the application and ensure API quotas are not exceeded.
Advanced Error Handling: Implement a more sophisticated error-handling mechanism with detailed error codes and traceability.
Unit test: I would have write unit test and use packages like Moq and fluent assertion
------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
2. What was the most useful feature that was added to the latest version of your
language of choice?



----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. How would you track down a performance issue in production? Have you ever
had to do this?
Logging: Check structured logs for potential bottlenecks or frequent errors.
Database Optimization: Analyze slow database queries using tools like SQL Server Profiler or explain plans.
Code Review: Look for inefficient algorithms or unoptimized code.
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. What was the latest technical book you have read or tech conference you have been to? What did you learn?
unit testing principles practices and patterns
Im learn these subject of this book: 
1. Why Unit Testing is Important
2. Characteristics of Good Unit Tests
3.Code Coverage And Branch Coverage
4. Writing Maintainable Tests
5. Is Unit Testing always good and Is high coverage of code is good or not 
6.Branch Coverage and code Coverage
I am still reading this book, but I haven't read it in a while due to interview sessions
----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
5. What do you think about this technical assessment?
This assessment was well-structured . It provided a good opportunity to demonstrate knowledge of:
Web API development with .NET Core.
Best practices for clean code, SOLID principles, and dependency injection.
Real-world scenarios, such as integrating external APIs and error handling.
The inclusion of both coding and theoretical questions allowed a balanced evaluation of practical and conceptual understanding.
